A basic whiteboard with drawing features has already been bootstrapped for you. To run it:

2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. Access the app from http://localhost:3000

To complete the task, you can clone this repository (do not fork) and build on top of it, or you can start from scratch.

To submit, send a link with details on how to run the code to binu@vidyalai.com. Do not submit a pull request.
