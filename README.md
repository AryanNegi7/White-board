# Frontend Task

Create a basic web whiteboard using React and [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/articles/) on which users can

1. Draw curves
2. Erase drawn lines

Whiteboard UI - [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/b32qPPweMJPTZ29711DNtW/Frontend-Task?node-id=0%3A1) . Create an account in Figma to view the desig and download assets. The app you make should follow the design as closely as possible. 

A basic whiteboard with drawing features has already been bootstrapped for you. To run it:

1. Clone this repository to your system
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. Access the app from http://localhost:3000. Click and drag your mouse to draw.

To complete the task, you can clone this repository (do not fork) and build on top of it, or you can start from scratch.

To submit, send a link to the source code with details on how to run it, to binu@vidyalai.com. Do not submit a pull request.

Extra Credit:

1. Add multiple pages to the whiteboard
2. Make it collaborative (Like Google Jamboard, using firebase or custom server side code)
3. Add more tools (Pan, Shapes, Highlighter etc.)
